        <p>
        To build and maintain a positive environment, we ask you to follow these guidelines when interacting within our community:
        </p>

        <li>Be kind and respectful: Treat all members with courtesy and consideration. We do not tolerate offensive language, personal attacks, or intimidating behavior.</li>
        <li>Maintain a safe environment: We do not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination, or behavior that causes discomfort to other members. This includes derogatory comments based on gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or any other personal characteristic.</li>
        <li>Collaborate constructively: We value constructive criticism and different opinions. Express your ideas clearly and concisely, and be receptive to feedback from others.</li>
        <li>Respect privacy and intellectual property: Do not share others' private information without their consent. Also, respect the intellectual property of others and ensure you have the necessary rights before using or modifying third-party content.</li>

            <h2>Integrity and Ethical Conduct</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
        As a valued member of the Ramshackle Code community, we expect you to maintain the highest level of integrity and ethical conduct. Specifically, we strictly prohibit any involvement in activities that may constitute intellectual property crime, computer fraud, or data theft. These actions not only undermine the trust within our community but also go against the principles of fairness and honesty that we uphold.
        </p>
        <p>
        We emphasize the importance of adhering to legal and ethical standards in all aspects of your participation in our community. Any member found engaging in any form of intellectual property crime, computer fraud, or data theft will be subject to appropriate disciplinary measures, which may include expulsion from the community.

Therefore, authorization from the organization's administrators is required before copying, distributing, or disclosing the content of such repositories.</li>
